## NetCat Clone

I am learning go so i might as well do fun stuff.

Current Usage statement is still in progress...
```
nc [-lu] address
   -l       Listen on address, (:8888)
   -u       UDP protocol (default tcp)
   address  The local address when listening and remote address when acting as a client
```
